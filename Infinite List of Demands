While Occupy Wall Street found some freedom in refusing to demand anything from the powers that be, this is not necessary to the pursuit of freedom, and denies the need to negotiate with others which is the very basis of politics & sovereignty. One can make a demand, many demands even, while validating one's own power and strength. It is only in elevating the expectation that someone else must be the one to fulfill our demands that we cede our own power to an other, and give up responsibility for providing for ourselves.

Demands can be used to communicate our concerns and critiques of the society in which we live. They can motivate us toward a goal that is something we actually desire.

infinite list of demands: GO!
