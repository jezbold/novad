ESSENTIAL QUESTIONS: 
*Activist Safewhouse or Education center?
*Who is this sanctuary intended for? Have they helped to inform the space & resources that it provides? 
*How would poor / undocumented / ppl from Newark for example access this?
*What sort of tangible resources would be available there if any?

The vision shared with comrades is to create a “safehouse” in upstate New York, United States, which is a node (a unique autonomous centre) with its own “school” dedicated to advancing skills, knowledge and relationships.

This node in the “circuit of resistance” is a physical space run by a community of trusted guardians/hosts that are responsible for:
(1) getting the house up and running 
(2) setting up specific curricula and 
(3) attracting prospective guests.
